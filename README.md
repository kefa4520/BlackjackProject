### MVP
Each player is dealt 2 cards. The dealer is dealt 2 cards with one face-up and one face-down;
Cards are equal to their value with face cards being 10 and an Ace being 11;
The players cards are added up for their total;
If player's cards value or dealer's cards value are 21 after each is dealt 2 cards, whoever has 21 wins (Blackjack);
Players “Hit” to gain another card from the deck. Players “Stay” to keep their current card total;
If dealer's cards value is less than 17, dealer "Hits" until they equal or exceed 17;
The goal of the game is to have a higher card total than the dealer without going over 21;
If the player total and the dealer total are even, it is a “Push” and the hand ends;
